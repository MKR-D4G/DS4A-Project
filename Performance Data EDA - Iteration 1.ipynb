This data is available per cohort over the duration of their high school career. For example, datasets for 2016-2017 captures data related to the high school cohort that started 9th grade in 2013-2014 and were slated to graduate 2016-2017.\n",

    "Also, to protect student privacy, data has been suppressed in instances where * is represented in a file - largely because the cohort size is 10 or less. Also, in instances where a race/ethinicity group is suppressed due to aforementioned, all data in that cluster is not reported for other race/ethnic groups."

There is consistency across which columns have null data as __DistrictCode, SchoolCode, DistrictName__ and __SchoolName__ seem to be the only fields with NULL data across the 3 datasets. Thus, the decision to leave as is and concatenate the 3 dataframes ahead of further analysis and cleaning. The underlying assumption is that the the rows missing this data are those aggregated at the State __\"T\"__ and County **\"C\"** level as it seems logical they will not have either Disctrict or School code and/or name. If in the course of cleaning/further analysis this changes, we will update assumption.\n",
